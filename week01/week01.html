            JavaScript – Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Arrays show me examples using the language. <br />
            This is often just code of code sake. But show me you can use a for loop, switch statement, conditional code. <br />
            Create and use functions. Iterate through an array. Use and add to an associative array.
