To begin with, a brief explanation of what bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, is. Although the notion of digital currencies has existed long before Bitcoin’s debut…Nakamoto introduced a distributed public ledger that serializes a record of all confirmed transactions knows as the blockchain” [3, p. 1]. Through this method, the operations of the possessors of cryptocurrency are allowed privacy and discretion in purchases. Through this “peer-to-peer network” the buyer goes through public keys to make purchases. There have been many attempts to keep the privacy of bitcoin in the past, like with the creation of Bitcoin Fog, Coinjoin, and through generating multiple addresses; unfortunately, partially with the rapid rise in popularity along with scale, so rose the same opportunity to gather more salient user information. 
	On September 5, 2013 came the emergence of CryptoLocker. It’s interesting to note, that “CryptoLocker comes in the door through social engineering techniques” [1, p. 146]. This was the creation of new ransomware that “encrypted files on a victim’s system until a ransom was paid. The decryption keys were withheld by the thread actors who demanded ransoms to be paid either through MoneyPak or Bitcoin within 732 hours, otherwise the decryption keys would (allegedly) be destroyed and recovery of the encrypted files would be virtually impossible.” The attack vector of this malware was twofold: in the first, there were SPAM emails sent do business professionals in the form of “customer complaints”. Later, in October 7, 2013, through Gameover ZeuS, “a peer-to-peer botnet that used Cutwail spam botnet to send massive amounts of SPAM email impersonating well-established online retailers and financial institutions" [2, p. 2-3] was then created. 
	Since the outbreak of these different ransomware attacks, there have been more that have come about because of it. There is an estimated $310, 472.38 USD that is believed to have been extorted so far. It can easily be seen that bitcoin is not impenetrable. While there are many users of bitcoin who may want to use it merely for privacy, there still exists another group of people who would use bitcoin for what is considered as less than ethical means as well like gambling or other illicit activities. However, with things like Bitiodine which “has been tested on several real-world cases” culprits can actually be brought to justice like when the FBI tracked “a payment by Dread Pirate Roberts, founder of the Silk Road, to a hitman to have a person killed.” [2, p. 2]. “By analyzing the blockchain and correlating it with this publicly available meta data, it is possible to find addressed used (e.g., for gambling, mining, or for scams)” [2, p. 2]. This goes to show, that there is a limit to how powerful the idea of cryptocurrency is  and the security that it proposes.
