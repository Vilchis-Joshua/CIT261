    <h1>JavaScript!</h1>
    <p>
        We are going to talk about JavaScript and some of the aspects of it today.<br />
        JavaScript – Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Arrays show me examples using the language. <br />
        This is often just code of code sake. But show me you can use a for loop, switch statement, conditional code. <br />
        Create and use functions. Iterate through an array. Use and add to an associative array.
