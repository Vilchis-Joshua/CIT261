    <!--This assignment is taking place in week03 of the semester, and is the teaching of JavaScript stuff.
    JavaScript – Object Creation Functions, Properties, Methods, Instantiation
    show me work where you create an object that contains data and functions.
    Use ‘new’ to create several types of that object, modify the object attributes and call the associated functions-->
    <h1>JavaScript!</h1>
    <p>
        We are going to talk about JavaScript and some of the aspects of it today.<br />
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            1) Object creation functions<br />
            There are two different methods of choice that allow you to be able to create an object. <br />
            You can use an object literal, or use the new operator, but the result is the same. as can be seen below.<br />
        </p>
        <button id="createfirstobject" onclick="createFirstObject()">Create Object</button>

        <p id="firstpart"></p>

        <p>
            If you don't understand how to create the object, press the button below
        </p>
        <p id="first_part_code">
            var first_person = {<br />
                &emsp; "Joseph",<br />
                &emsp; "Smith",<br />
                &emsp; "male",<br />
                <br />
                &emsp; function () {<br />
                    &emsp; &emsp; this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;<br />
                }<br />
            }<br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Within the class, there are a couple of different, important aspects.<br />
            First: What are properties?<br />
            Second: What are methods?<br />
            Third: What is instantiation? <br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Properties:<br />
            Properties are the  values that are associated an object.<br />
            In the case of the example above, it is the "first name",<br />
            "last name", and the "gender".<br />
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The methods are the functions that are associated with an object.<br />
            In this case, it is the "fullName()" function. <br />
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Instantiation is a word that just means "creating the object".<br />
        </p>
    </div>
