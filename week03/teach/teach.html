    <!--This assignment is taking place in week03 of the semester, and is the teaching of JavaScript stuff.
    JavaScript – Object Creation Functions, Properties, Methods, Instantiation
    show me work where you create an object that contains data and functions.
    Use ‘new’ to create several types of that object, modify the object attributes and call the associated functions-->
    <h1>JavaScript!</h1>
    <p>
        We are going to talk about JavaScript and some of the aspects of it today.<br />
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>
            1) Object creation functions<br />
            There are two different methods of choice that allow you to be able to create an object. <br />
            You can use an object literal, or use the new operator, but the result is the same. as can be seen below.<br />
        </h2>
        <button id="createfirstobject" onclick="createFirstObject()">Create Object</button>

        <p id="firstpart"></p>

        <p id="first_part_code">
            //This is the first method that will be discussed to instatiate an object.<br />
            //This is the object literal method<br />
            var first_person = {<br />
            &emsp; "Joseph",<br />
            &emsp; "Smith",<br />
            &emsp; "male",<br />
            <br />
            &emsp; function () {<br />
            &emsp; &emsp; this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;<br />
            }<br />
            }<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p id="first_part_code">
            //This is the second method that will be discussed to instatiate an object.<br />
            //This method uses the JavaScript keyword "new"<br />
            var person = new Object()<br />
            person.firstName = "Joseph";<br />
            person.lastName = "Smith";<br />
            person.gender = "male";<br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>
            Within the class, there are a couple of different, important aspects.<br />
            First: What are properties?<br />
            Second: What are methods?<br />
            Third: What is instantiation? <br />
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Properties</h4>
        <p>
            Properties:<br />
            Properties are the  values that are associated an object.<br />
            In the case of the example above, it is the "first name",<br />
            "last name", and the "gender".<br />
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>
            The methods are the functions that are associated with an object.<br />
            In this case, it is the "fullName()" function. <br />
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Instantiation and differences</h4>
        <p>
            Instantiation is a word that just means "creating the object".<br />
            The important thing to note that's different between the two methods, is how things are created.<br />
            In the first method, everything is created at the one time in a variable. In the second method, <br />
            the object is first created, using the new operator, then the properties are created afterwards. <br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            How would you change the values of the properties?<br />
            The method is simple: Call the property again and change value like a regular variable.<br />
        </p>

        <p id="first_part_code">
            //This is how you change the value<br />
            var person = new Object()<br />
            person.firstName = "Joseh";<br />
            person.lastName = "Smith";<br />
            person.gender = "male";<br />
            <br /><br />

            person.firstName = "Joseph";<br />
        </p>
    </div>
